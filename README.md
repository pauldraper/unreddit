## Description

Unlike most other social networks, Reddit delegates the vast majority of moderation to its community of users.
Unfortunately, these moderators often censor dissenting opinions, even if their contents do not violate Reddit's terms of service.

Unreddit reverses this unduly aggressive censorship.
